# CME295_Study_Notes
This is a study note repository. The notes are based on the course CME295: Transformer &amp; Large Language Models offered at Stanford University in Fall 2025. They are compiled from three sources: core knowledge from the course slides, key points emphasized by the instructor, and extended reading of relevant academic papers.
